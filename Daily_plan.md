    - **01 - What is a Data structure?**
        - A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. 
        - It defines the relationship between data elements, and provides a framework for efficiently performing operations on the data. 
        - Different data structures are suited to different kinds of applications and can significantly affect the performance and efficiency of a program. 
    - **02 - Types of Data structures**
        - The Data types are can be classified in to two types 
            - 01. Linear data structures 
            - 02. Non-linear data structures
