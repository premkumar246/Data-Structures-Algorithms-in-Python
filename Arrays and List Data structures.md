# Array & Python List 
- An Array data structure is a homogeneous, linear data structure which stores collection of data in contiguos blocks of memory. 
- Arrays allow for efficient access to elements via indices, which are integer values representing the position of elements within the array. 
### Key charecteristics
- Fixed in size
- Index based access of elements
- Homogenous data  
- Contigious memory allocation 
### Types of Array 
- One-dimensional Array 
    - One dimensional array is an array with a single index.
    - It has only one row and multiple columns. 
- Multi-dimensional Array 
    - Arrays with morethan 1 dimension are called Multi-dimensional arrays. 
    - Arrays with 2D, 3D widely used.
